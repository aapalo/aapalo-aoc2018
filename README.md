# Advent of code 2018

My solutions for [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2018) programming puzzles.


## Runtimes:
Used time.time() to measure the time difference in seconds.
Running CPython via terminal and Atom took the same time, so values for Atom are shown.

| Program  | Atom     | pypy3   | Atom/pypy3 |
| -------- | :------: | :-----: | :--------: |
| 1-1      | 0.001    | 0.005   | 0.2        |
| 1-2      | 105      | 4.4     | 25.9       |
| 2-1      |     |    |     |
| 2-2      |     |    |     |
